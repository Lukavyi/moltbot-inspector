{"id":"moltbot-inspector-7pd","title":"Progress key collision: files with same sessionId overwrite each other's read state","description":"## Bug\n\nWhen multiple JSONL files share the same sessionId (e.g. base file + topic file), clicking between them overwrites each other's progress (lastReadId, unreadCount, totalMsgs) because progress.json is keyed by sessionId only.\n\n## Example\n- `550cb2b5-...-topic-992872.jsonl` (68 lines)\n- `550cb2b5-....jsonl` (7 lines)\n- Both have sessionId `550cb2b5-...` → single progress key\n\n## Root cause\n`progressKey` in App.tsx uses `sessionId || filename`. Multiple files can have the same sessionId.\n\n## Proposed fix (option D)\nComposite key: `sessionId:topicId` where topicId is parsed from filename suffix (`-topic-XXXXX`). Topic number = Telegram thread ID, stable across renames/deletes. Base files keep plain sessionId as key. Old progress entries remain compatible.\n\n## Migration needed\nMerge old progress from `~/.moltbot-inspector/progress.json` (359 keys, 37KB) into new `~/.openclaw-inspector/progress.json` (270 keys, 20KB) — rename lost all read marks.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"lukavyi@me.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T09:54:53.760334+01:00","created_by":"Clawdbot","updated_at":"2026-02-02T09:54:53.760334+01:00"}
